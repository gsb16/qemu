## Project Objective
Creation of build rules that generate API documentation from C and Python source code and further analysis between the use of GTK-Doc syntax or another alternatives. Also work on the existing documentation for some improvement in clarity or formatting.

## Phase 1
* Learn about QEMU.
* Study QEMU Makefile rules.
* Research about GTK-Doc and check if it has viability.
* Figure out how to use GTK-Doc to check documentation coverage.

## Phase 2
* Learn about Sphinx.
* Study kernel-docs.
* Evaluate some tools for generating documentation from comments.
* Try to apply Peter Maydell's patches and use them as a starting point.
* Research alternatives for publishing documentation online.

## Phase 3
* Implement code necessary to generate documentation for subset of QEMU APIs.
* Use Continuous Integration to update documentation as the code is changed in master branch.
* Create Travis jobs necessary to commit new documentation.
* Rebase all code commited to repository so that each commit has the correct format for a patch.
* Organize the documentation files into something more coherent.
* Send online documentation generated to qemu-devel.
* Send RFCs to qemu-devel.

## Accomplished Work
### Community Bounding
I had very little interaction with the QEMU development community. I spent a lot of time studying and working, since I had a hard time with everything I needed to learn. I hope to have great interaction with the QEMU community in the next months, as my RFCs are answered and discussed.
